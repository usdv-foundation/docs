# Vault

All tokenized assets and generated yields are stored in a globally unique **Vault** on **Ethereum**, the most secure and decentralized L1 chain in the market.

The Vault **issues, tracks and updates** the mint of each color, which represents the sum of circulation for a given color across all chains.&#x20;

This mint can be used to calculate the contribution of a given color to the global circulation across all blockchains, which can be used in turn to fairly distribute yields.&#x20;

After USDV is minted in the Vault, it is atomically transferred to the Minterâ€™s wallet on the primary chain, from where it can be transferred to other chains or wallets.
