## STBT

STBT(Short-term Treasury Bill Token) is the first reserve asset chosen by USDV.

Exclusively designed for accredited investors, STBT is an ERC 1400 standard token, allowing holders to tap into risk-free US T-bill yields. Interest is rebased to holders' STBT balances on each business day.

1 STBT is pegged to 1 USD of net-asset value (NAV), fully backed by the US dollar and US Treasury securities with maturities within 6 months and reverse repurchase agreements.

STBT is issued by Matrixdock, a digital asset platform that provides access to Real World Assets (RWA) through tokenization, a brand fully owned by Matrixport.
