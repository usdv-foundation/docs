# USDV Overview

**Verified USD (USDV)** is the first omnichain stablecoin that rewards Verified Minters based on their contribution to the token's active circulation.

USDV is currently available on Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Optimism.

## How USDV Works

The protocol [marks USDV tokens with a unique "colour"](what-is-usdv/how-coloring-works.md) to identify who originally minted them, and track how they are used across different blockchains.

**Verified Minters** earn more yield by increasing the circulation of USDV in their colour. The more a minter changes the colour of tokens in the market (by having others use their coloured tokens), the greater the yield they receive.

This creates an economic incentive for minters to not only mint USDV, but also to ensure its active circulation, enhancing the liquidity and utility of the token in the broader DeFi landscape.

## Why use USDV?

USDV is the first stablecoin designed to empower CeFi, DeFi and other modern businesses.

* **Become a Minter:** Partners can [become a 'Verified Minter'](verified-minters/initial-kyc.md) with successful KYC, unlocking the right to mint USDV and access to Real World Yield.
* **Real World Yield Share:** Novel token marking algorithm, [ColorTrace](concepts/coloring.md), to enable transparent & fair yield sharing based on USDV circulation contributed by each 'Verified Minter'.
* **Always native:** ERC-20 compatible, USDV is built on the [Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT)](https://layerzero.network/developers) Standard, eliminating unofficial wrapped/bridged versions and liquidity fragmentation.
* **Next Level Transparency:** Full transparency from real time on-chain transaction tracking, reserve proofing to daily real world asset monitoring.

Bridging the best of CeFi and DeFi, USDV transcends borders, blockchains and operating hours.
