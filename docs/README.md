# What is Verified USD (USDV)

Verified USD (USDV) is an omnichain stable coin fully backed by quality assets.&#x20;

It is designed with full transparency in mind that:

1. All back assets are required to present frequent PoR (Proof of Reserve) updates.&#x20;
2. USDV's circulation and issuances are fully transparent on-chain.
3. The yields generated from the interest of the backing assets are fairly and provably distributed to ecosystem partners on-chain. Minters of USDV earn yield pro-rata from the Vault based on their token circulation for their contributions to the USDV adoption.
