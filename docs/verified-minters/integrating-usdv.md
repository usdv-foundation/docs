# Integrating USDV

As a **Verified Minter** in the USDV ecosystem, you not only have the opportunity to contribute to the stability and expansion of USDV, but also have the potential for significant rewards based on your coloured token's circulation.

## Why Become a Verified Minter?

* **Stability and Availability**: Your role in minting and circulating USDV directly influences its stability and utility across various blockchains.
* **Rewards for Active Circulation**: USDV uniquely rewards minters who actively circulate USDV in the market.
* **Strategic Advantage**: Being a Verified Minter allows you to strategically position your application or protocol within the broader DeFi ecosystem to attract a broader audience to use your USDV colour.

## Maximizing Circulation and Rewards

Maximize your rewards as a Verified Minter by integrating your coloured tokens to popular DeFi applications to increase circulation:

* [**Integrate with DEXs**](../app-integrations/privacy-and-cookie-policy.md): Deploying USDV within DEX Pairs/Pools not only increases liquidity, but also exposes USDV to a broader trading audience that will use your token colour.
* [**Collateral and Borrowing Options**](../app-integrations/lending-and-borrowing.md): Adding USDV as a collateral or borrowing option in lending protocols increases its utility while increasing your colour's usage.
* [**Expand Wallet Offerings**](../app-integrations/terms-and-conditions.md): Any wallets that including USDV in your wallet offerings provides users with more options and increases your colour's usage.

## Earning More Yield Through _Recolouring_

Your yield earnings are directly tied to how effectively you circulate and recolour USDV:

* **Recolouring for Higher Yield**: The more USDV tokens are recoloured under your colour (through active circulation and usage), the greater your share of the yield.
* **TVL and Volume Impact**: Applications with higher Total Value Locked (TVL) or volume in USDV can potentially earn more yield, as they are contributing more significantly to the circulation and demand of USDV.
