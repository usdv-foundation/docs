Click the _**Launch App**_ button (upper right corner) to start.

You will be immediately redirected to the Web App's 'Mint' page. You must connect your whitelisted wallet for full access, otherwise you will only have default **‘Mint’** and **‘Redeem’** functions.

Back to the **'Mint'** page. You can mint USDV by supplying STBT. Enter the supply amount. Supply and mint are on a 1:1 basis.

## Set Color

An important feature of USDV is ColorTrace. Minters can mint their USDV in any of the circulating colors. If you are a ‘Verified Minter’, the default color will be your assigned color. Here, our default (and assigned) color is 14.

Click on the pen icon to change your choice of color. Colors are recorded as unique positive integers. The number of colors is capped by the number of ‘Verified Minters’ in the USDV ecosystem.
