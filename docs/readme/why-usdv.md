# Why USDV?

### 1. Always Native

Superior user experience plus **deep unified liquidity** (i.e no unofficial wrapped/bridged versions and no liquidity fragmentation).



### 2. Omni-chain scalability

USDV does not require bridging to move cross-chain. USDV can be made available on any of **40+ L1 and L2 chains** supported by LayerZero’s interoperability protocol.



### 3. Less de-pegging risk

USDV is 100% backed by high quality, highly liquid tokenized real world assets. **No algorithmic rebalancing. No volatile crypto assets. No illiquid real world assets.**



### 4. Novel yield generation and distribution mechanism

Real world yield directly passed to **Verified Minters** (i.e traffic generators). Complete traceability and fair yield distribution powered by LayerZero’s **ColorTrace** ‘token marking’ technology.



### 5. Full transparency and regulatory compliance

Real time on-chain reserve proofing and permission-less access to all transaction records.
