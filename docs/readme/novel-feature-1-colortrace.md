# Novel feature 1: ColorTrace

Stablecoins are permission-less by design.&#x20;

Currently there is no technology that allows minters to trace minted tokens, nor a mechanism that allows fair & transparent distribution of yield rewards to ecosystem players who generate demand for minted tokens.

**ColorTrace**, a LayerZero technology, enables novel 'token coloring' for all USDV in circulation, allowing segmentation by Verified Minters based on **unique Color IDs** (similar to Bitcoin's UTXO structure).

With **ColorTrace**, all USDV in circulation are directed to Real World Yield, with (re)coloring tied to distribution volumes generated by each Verified Minter.

Yield Rewards are then be distributed atomically based on each Verified Minter's **Color Shares** (USDV with Verified Minter's color as % of total USDV in circulation), promoting an equitable distribution of rewards based on actual user demand and engagement.

Any protocol may become a Verified Minter with their own unique Color upon completion of KYC process.
