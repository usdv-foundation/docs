# Novel feature 2: OFT

**Omnichain Fungible Tokens OFT** is an ERC-20 compatible token standard developed upon LayerZero's interoperability protocol to allow seamless communication between EVM and non-EVM chains.

The benefits of OFTs extend far beyond their innovative design:

1. **Enhanced Security:** The reliance on Relayers and Oracles for validation adds an extra layer of security compared to independent token contracts.
2. **Efficient Liquidity:** OFTs automatically provide cross-chain liquidity, eliminating the need for liquidity pools on multiple chains and simplifying the bridging process.
3. **Cost Savings and Improved Security:** The absence of cross-chain liquidity pools or wrappers reduces vulnerabilities and potential hacking risks.
4. **Seamless Cross-Chain Activity:** OFTs enable tokens to exist simultaneously on multiple chains, easing token transfers and swaps across different networks.

LayerZero endpoints are currently deployed in 40+ L1 and L2 chains, with the default Oracle secured by **Google Cloud**.
