# Yield Distribution

Yield bearing assets in the vault generate yields, which can be minted into USDV to reward the minters for their contribution to USDV's ecosystem.&#x20;

Every time the vault has more assets than that are collateralised to maintain the 1:1 USDV peg, the excess can be converted into USDV permissionlessly and credit to the minters linearly to their Vault Shares, which is similar to LP position in a DEFI farm.&#x20;

Vault shares are created from minting USDV with collaterals or reminting USDV of other colors. The reminting mechanism will be descirbed in another section.
