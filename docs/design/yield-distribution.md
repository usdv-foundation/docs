# Yield Distribution

## Vault mechanics

The globally unique Vault stores yield bearing Tokenized Real World Assets as collateral for USDV.

USDV’s current and only underlying asset is STBT, which bears yield passively and gets re-based 1:1 USD on a daily basis.&#x20;

In simple mathematical terms: USDV (end of day) = USDV (start of day) + USDV (yield generated that day)&#x20;

In the case that yield is positive, it is automatically and permissionlessly minted into USDV to reward Verified Minter’s for their contribution to the USDV ecosystem.

## Fair and transparent yield distribution

One minted USDV = one colour share.&#x20;

Each colour share represents a Verified Minter’s claim to the global pool of yield rewards. To ensure clear and direct attribution, each Verified Minter is assigned a unique Color ID.

Global yield is then divided and coloured linearly based on the Vault’s colour shareholding at end of each day. The newly coloured USDV is stored in the Vault until Verified Minter decides to exercise redemption rights.&#x20;

All transactions revolving yield coloring and distribution are stored on-chain, allowing permissionless public verification.

## Token value stability and assurance

USDV is always redeemable for US Dollars.&#x20;

USDV’s underlying asset, STBT is monitored real time on-chain (see [Chainlink Proof of Reserve](../maximum-transparency.md)).&#x20;

STBT Reserves are held in the management and custody of leading financial institutions such as BNY Mellon. Reserves are monitored and reported to the USDV Transparency Panel on a daily basis.&#x20;

The USDV Reserve report includes full asset holding disclosure with assurance by a Top 5 global independent accounting firm that Reserves are equal or larger than the amount of USDV in circulation. USDV financial statements are audited annually.
